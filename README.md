# Codecademy C Language Skill Path
This is a private repository for my C Language Skill Path projects and notes.

## Running a C project
1. Use the built in 'clang' compiler from Apple's Xcode tools to compile the C application.
2. Run `clang appname.c -o compiledAppName` command
3. Run the program with `./compiledAppName` command

This command compiles the program, and the `-o compiledAppName` will set a name for the compiled program that's ready to be run. You need to be in the correct directory that houses the project for this to work. Otherwise, change directory to the correct place.

## Useful tips for writing C programs
- Make sure to include `#include <stdio.h>` at the top of the document to allow certain functions to run
